Toolkit for Stormwater-Management-Model
===========================

ORD Stormwater Management Model (aka "SWMM")

Introduction
------------
This is the open source SWMM source code repository maintained by Ingeniousware GmbH and intended to create a toolkit from the original SWMM analysis engine.

SWMM is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water quality simulation model. It is used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. SWMM source code is written in the C Programming Language and released in the Public Domain.


Objectives
------------

   - Create a Visual Studio solution for SWMM   
   - Add additional toolkit capabilities to the SWMM analysis engine
   - Make easily accessible the SWMM functionalities to .Net developers through a wrapper written in c#

This project has been forked from USEPA/Stormwater-Management-Model
